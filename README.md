Price Check

This application lets a user search for their favotire games on some of the most popular online video stores and returns the pricing 
information from those stores. The user is able to log in and save their favorites, which are displayed in the favorites bar on the left. 

The profile page is a placeholder, it also displays the user's favorited games. 

The application uses a series of custom built HTML parsing APIs in order to retrieve the relevant informaiton and send it to the backend to
be displayed for the user's needs. In the case of the Steam store, there are 2 unnoficial APIs being pinged that serve to find the relevant 
search result because the steam store uses it's own unique APP ID codes to categorize games in their store.
